P.O.S. for a fast food restaurant in DCIT 23A in the second semester of first year

One of our program's features is the ability to enter a user name and display desired menus. You can order in bulk, The program can detect when a category is sold out, calculate the total amount per transaction, calculate the customers change, print a receipt, return items, cancel an order. When a user wants to buy again, there is a 95% chance that at least one item will be unavailable.
